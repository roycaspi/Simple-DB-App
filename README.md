# Simple-DB-App
This project is a simple key-value variable store implemented using Google App Engine (GAE). The app listens to HTTP requests and performs database-like operations via query parameters. It supports variable setting, retrieval, unsetting, undo/redo actions, and value-based counts, with persistence backed by Google Datastore.
